# iCodeQA

The purpose of this repository:

- A platform for questions and answers (Q&A) for the [coding club of iDiv](https://intranet.idiv.de/en/groups-people/default-9c9fba7eb0.html);
- Ask questions related to R, Python, bash/sh, C++, SQL, and other languages that we use as data scientists in biodiversity research;
- Ask questions related to statistics/data science methods;
- Learn together and kindly support each other;

We want to assure you that this is a safe space to ask without judgments, irrespective of your experience.
Moderation can be done on a voluntary basis by anyone who becomes an administrator of this repository. 

This is a public repository. One can create a GitHub account [here](https://github.com/signup).
Then, anyone with a GitHub account can open an issue like this:

![Selection_132](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14074269/196666393-514cff7f-d6cc-44b4-8b42-053176137414.jpg)

![Selection_133](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/14074269/196666470-0f0d9591-1431-40d1-8519-eddb96b0f952.jpg)

Then give a title to the issue and, try as much as possible, to provide a simple reproducible example that others can try on their computers. We should follow the same guidelines as those offered by StackOverflow [here](https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask).

My example is not perfect, but you can have a look at [this](https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity/iCodeQA/issues/1). 
You can simply drag & drop images into the editing box of the issue, so no need to write any markdown code for inserting an image.

When you want to provide the lines of code that you tried, you can wrap the lines of code like this (includes Syntax highlighting for the specific language):

For R:

    ```r
    library(data.table)
    # this is a comment
    ```

For Python:

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    # this is a comment
    ```

For more editing options, please see [Creating and highlighting code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks)

People can be referred to by their user names like: @user_name.
Anyone can comment on an issue and add their solution or ask for further clarification.
